It\u2019s important to note that trading is inherently risky and could lose more than expected if don\u2019t take the\nappropriate risk management steps. Trading happens between two parties and often involves a dealer network. No central, physical\nlocation only a virtual network of participants. Timings 24/7. Contracts are Customized.

These instruments range from a variety of assets\nassigned a financial value that can go up or down. Trading involves vigorous participation in the financial markets compared to\ninvesting, which works on a buy-and-hold strategy. The success of trading is dependent on the ability of a trader to be profitable over a\nperiod of time.\nA trader is a person who gets involved in buying and selling a financial asset in any financial market. He or she can buy or sell either for\nhimself/herself or on behalf of another individual or institution. The main difference between an investor and a trader is the duration for\nwhich he or she holds on to the asset.\nA trader is a person who engages in the short-term purchasing and selling of equity either for an institution or for themselves.\n1.3.What is a Candlestick\nA candle stick is a type of price chart used in technical analysis that displays the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a\nspecific period.\nwherein each candlestick details a single day\u2019s trading.

It is a double-edged sword that can magnify both gains\nand losses. The leverage is the amount of money that a trader is willing to risk on a trade. It is important to set the leverage to a level\nthat is comfortable for the trader and that will not cause financial hardship if the trade is lost.\nLeverage types\n1/8/25, 2:30 PM Karbon User Guide\nhttps://avishkanirmitha.github.io/karbon-doc/ 26/33\nIn the Karabon platform, there are 4 types of actions that can be triggered as per your settings\nClose Trade\nChange Leverage\nChange lLeverage Type\nRepurcherse\nClose Trades\nIn this take action, users can define a profit or loss percentage and position size that need to close.

This platform could potentially assist in closing trades automatically when they\nreach a profitable point. This streamlined approach ensures a user-friendly experience that stands out from traditional trading platforms\n1.2.What is Trading\nTrading is the buying and selling of financial instruments in order to make a profit. These instruments range from a variety of assets\nassigned a financial value that can go up or down. Trading involves vigorous participation in the financial markets compared to\ninvesting, which works on a buy-and-hold strategy. The success of trading is dependent on the ability of a trader to be profitable over a\nperiod of time.\nA trader is a person who gets involved in buying and selling a financial asset in any financial market. He or she can buy or sell either for\nhimself/herself or on behalf of another individual or institution. The main difference between an investor and a trader is the duration for\nwhich he or she holds on to the asset.\nA trader is a person who engages in the short-term purchasing and selling of equity either for an institution or for themselves.\n1.3.What is a Candlestick\nA candle stick is a type of price chart used in technical analysis that displays the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a\nspecific period.\nwherein each candlestick details a single day\u2019s trading. It has three essential features:\nThe body, which represents the open-to-close range\nThe wick, or shadow, that indicates the intra-day high and low\npattern indicators that are available on the platform. Essentially, the strategy differs from the CandlePatternsMultiple strategy only by\ncalculated indicator count and by the way the list of indicators gets compiled.\nThis real body represents the price range between the open and close of that day's trading. When the real body is filled in or black (also\nred), it means the close was lower than the open. If the real body is white (or green), the close was higher than the open.\n1.4.What is a Candle Indicator\nThis indicator paints each candle green, red, or blue depending on whether the buy/sell pressure for that candle is bullish, bearish, or\nneutral.\n1.5.How to Use Indicator\nWhen the directional movement index indicator shows more buying pressure than selling pressure, the candle will appear lime green.\nThis indicates bullish buying pressure. When the directional movement index indicator shows more selling pressure than buying\npressure, the candle will appear red. This indicates bearish selling pressure. When the directional movement index indicator shows the\nsame amount of buy and sell pressure, the candle will appear blue. This indicates neutral buy/sell pressure. 8 Use the color changes to\nsee if there is more buying or selling to pinpoint reversals and understand current market buying.

These instruments range from a variety of assets\nassigned a financial value that can go up or down. Trading involves vigorous participation in the financial markets compared to\ninvesting, which works on a buy-and-hold strategy. The success of trading is dependent on the ability of a trader to be profitable over a\nperiod of time.\nA trader is a person who gets involved in buying and selling a financial asset in any financial market. He or she can buy or sell either for\nhimself/herself or on behalf of another individual or institution. The main difference between an investor and a trader is the duration for\nwhich he or she holds on to the asset.\nA trader is a person who engages in the short-term purchasing and selling of equity either for an institution or for themselves.\n1.3.What is a Candlestick\nA candle stick is a type of price chart used in technical analysis that displays the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a\nspecific period.\nwherein each candlestick details a single day\u2019s trading.

It is a double-edged sword that can magnify both gains\nand losses. The leverage is the amount of money that a trader is willing to risk on a trade. It is important to set the leverage to a level\nthat is comfortable for the trader and that will not cause financial hardship if the trade is lost.\nLeverage types\n1/8/25, 2:30 PM Karbon User Guide\nhttps://avishkanirmitha.github.io/karbon-doc/ 26/33\nIn the Karabon platform, there are 4 types of actions that can be triggered as per your settings\nClose Trade\nChange Leverage\nChange lLeverage Type\nRepurcherse\nClose Trades\nIn this take action, users can define a profit or loss percentage and position size that need to close.
