This platform could potentially assist in closing trades automatically when they\nreach a profitable point. This streamlined approach ensures a user-friendly experience that stands out from traditional trading platforms\n1.2.What is Trading\nTrading is the buying and selling of financial instruments in order to make a profit. These instruments range from a variety of assets\nassigned a financial value that can go up or down. Trading involves vigorous participation in the financial markets compared to\ninvesting, which works on a buy-and-hold strategy. The success of trading is dependent on the ability of a trader to be profitable over a\nperiod of time.\nA trader is a person who gets involved in buying and selling a financial asset in any financial market. He or she can buy or sell either for\nhimself/herself or on behalf of another individual or institution. The main difference between an investor and a trader is the duration for\nwhich he or she holds on to the asset.\nA trader is a person who engages in the short-term purchasing and selling of equity either for an institution or for themselves.\n1.3.What is a Candlestick\nA candle stick is a type of price chart used in technical analysis that displays the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a\nspecific period.\nwherein each candlestick details a single day\u2019s trading. It has three essential features:\nThe body, which represents the open-to-close range\nThe wick, or shadow, that indicates the intra-day high and low\npattern indicators that are available on the platform. Essentially, the strategy differs from the CandlePatternsMultiple strategy only by\ncalculated indicator count and by the way the list of indicators gets compiled.\nThis real body represents the price range between the open and close of that day's trading. When the real body is filled in or black (also\nred), it means the close was lower than the open. If the real body is white (or green), the close was higher than the open.\n1.4.What is a Candle Indicator\nThis indicator paints each candle green, red, or blue depending on whether the buy/sell pressure for that candle is bullish, bearish, or\nneutral.\n1.5.How to Use Indicator\nWhen the directional movement index indicator shows more buying pressure than selling pressure, the candle will appear lime green.\nThis indicates bullish buying pressure. When the directional movement index indicator shows more selling pressure than buying\npressure, the candle will appear red. This indicates bearish selling pressure. When the directional movement index indicator shows the\nsame amount of buy and sell pressure, the candle will appear blue. This indicates neutral buy/sell pressure. 8 Use the color changes to\nsee if there is more buying or selling to pinpoint reversals and understand current market buying. Wait to enter or exit positions until the\ncandles turn the opposite color.\n1/8/25, 2:30 PM Karbon User Guide\nhttps://avishkanirmitha.github.io/karbon-doc/ 2/33\nCommon Errors\nSome common errors that can occur while using the hedge mode in Karbon:\nTracking Disabled errors\nIf any of the following errors appear in the log mentioned below, tracking will be disabled.\nunified account is forbidden\nAdjust will trigger liq\nPermission denied\napi_key expire\nAB not enough\ninvalid api_key\nunmatched ip\ncannot set leverage\nCannotAffordOrderCost\nposition idx not match position mode\nInsufficient position\nAPI key is invalid\nInvalid ACCESS_KEY\nThe order size is greater than the max open size\nUnable To Update The Leverage Factor Of This Position, There Is Not Enough Margin!\nUnmatched IP, please check your API key's bound IP addresses\ncurrent position is zero, cannot fix reduce-only order qty\nReduce-only rule not satisfied\n1/8/25, 2:30 PM Karbon User Guide\nhttps://avishkanirmitha.github.io/karbon-doc/ 32/33\nHome\nBrief introduction to Karbon UI\nWelcome Message & Links\n1/8/25, 2:30 PM Karbon User Guide\nhttps://avishkanirmitha.github.io/karbon-doc/ 5/33\nEx: In this stage, the trade will change the leverage type to cross 10x at negative 50% PnL.\nRepurchase\nRepurchase is a feature that allows users to repurchase the trade.

Limit orders are used to execute trades at a favorable price and can be set to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better.\n\nIn the context of trading platforms like Karbon, limit orders can be used to automate trading decisions based on predefined conditions, such as price levels.

If the profit of the hedge trade at the beginning is greater than or equal to the wallet balance multiplied by the selected percentage, both trades will close and reopen until the cycle count is finished.\n\n2. **Hedge Trade PnL Cycle Count**: You can define the cycle count using this setting. If a hedge trade is closed with a profit (after a user-defined stage using a checkbox), it triggers a new hedge trade pair. You can define how many times it needs to run; after the cycle count ends, no hedge trade is open for that pair.\n\n3. **Long and Short**: The documents also mention the concept of long and short trades. You can consider opening long trades when the market is expected to rise and short trades when the market is expected to fall.\n\n4. **Leverage**: The documents emphasize the importance of setting the leverage to a level that is comfortable for the trader and that will not cause financial hardship if the trade is lost. Leverage can be used to control a large position with a small amount of capital.\n\nPlease note that trading carries risks, and there are no guarantees of gains.

Make sure all fields are correctly filled and the template is properly configured.\n\n2. **Validate Stages**: Ensure that you have only one stage for trades selected to wait for a closing signal from TradingView. If you have multiple stages, they might not be closing as expected.\n\n3. **MM Settings**: Double-check your MM settings in the KarbonDX platform to ensure that they are correctly configured and in sync with your TradingVIEW template.\n\n4. **Tick Size**: Be aware of the tick size for each pair, as mentioned in the documentation (e.g., 0.001 BTC for BTC). This can affect the trade closing logic.\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue, I recommend checking the logs and configurations, validating the stages, and ensuring that your MM settings are correctly set up. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the Karbon support team for further assistance.",

These instruments range from a variety of assets\nassigned a financial value that can go up or down. Trading involves vigorous participation in the financial markets compared to\ninvesting, which works on a buy-and-hold strategy. The success of trading is dependent on the ability of a trader to be profitable over a\nperiod of time.\nA trader is a person who gets involved in buying and selling a financial asset in any financial market. He or she can buy or sell either for\nhimself/herself or on behalf of another individual or institution. The main difference between an investor and a trader is the duration for\nwhich he or she holds on to the asset.\nA trader is a person who engages in the short-term purchasing and selling of equity either for an institution or for themselves.\n1.3.What is a Candlestick\nA candle stick is a type of price chart used in technical analysis that displays the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security for a\nspecific period.\nwherein each candlestick details a single day\u2019s trading.

Trading involves vigorous participation in the financial markets compared to\ninvesting, which works on a buy-and-hold strategy. The success of trading is dependent on the ability of a trader to be profitable over a\nperiod of time.\nA trader is a person who gets involved in buying and selling a financial asset in any financial market. He or she can buy or sell either for\nhimself/herself or on behalf of another individual or institution.
