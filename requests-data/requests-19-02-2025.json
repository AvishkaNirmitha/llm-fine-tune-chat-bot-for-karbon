It's commonly referred to as the \"candle\" in Romanian because the term \"candelie\" means \"beautiful box.\"\n\n**a security for a specific period.** This indicator shows what the market is like at that particular point in time, and it provides valuable information about potential price reversals or buy-to-sabotage tendencies when trading over an open interval. For example, if you see 4 candeliex points out of the open interval, this means a bearish price reversal could be expected to occur between those points.\n\n**b security for a specific period.** If you see 30 candeliex points in the open interval and these points are not normally distributed, it's possible that a market correction is likely occurring. In this case, I would predict when the price is about to increase by at least 2 candeliex points (4-7 candeliex points) from the open interval to a breakout point (9 candeliex points or so), and then anticipate where the next market correction is likely occurring.\n\nThis indicator is useful for traders who want to identify potential bullish buying pressure, bearish selling pressure, or neutral buying pressure when they do trade over an open interval. It also provides valuable information about a potential trend reverses in the market.\n",

      "answer": "What a delightful task! A Candle Indicator is a visual display of individual candlestick details, which represent the market movement index (MVI) or trend signal for each candle in a stock's chart. It helps identify potential price movements by analyzing the characteristics of the MVI and how they interact with other factors in the market.\n\nHere are some examples of what a Candle Indicator might look like:\n\n1. A red wick on a Black Swan (BB) market is an indication that there will be a bullish buying pressure in the future, indicating potential price increases for the next week/month or month. This helps to identify a trend signal that can indicate bullish selling pressure in the medium term.\n2. A white wick on a White Swan (WNS) market is an indication of bearish selling pressure, signaling possible price declines and indicating potentially negative sentiment among investors over time.\n3. A yellow wick on a Brown Swan (GB) market represents a sell signal, indicating potential price reversals in the medium term. This helps to identify a trend signal that can indicate bullish selling pressure in the long term.\n4. An orange wick on a White Swan (WSN) market represents a bearish selling signal, signaling potentially negative sentiment among investors over time. This helps to identify a trend signal that can indicate bearish selling pressure in the medium term.\n5. A yellow wick on a Black Swan (NBQ) market is an indication of neutral buying signals, signaling potential price increases for the next week or month. This helps to identify a trend signal that can indicate neutral prices and signal potentially positive sentiment among investors over time.",

      "answer": "Trading works because, as a result of the technical analysis of trading positions, it's essential for traders to make rational decisions when allocating their capital and risk. Here are some key reasons why trading is such an effective way to secure a profit over time:\n\n1. **Accurate price discovery**: Trading involves being in possession of a real market value that can be used as leverage by the market maker. By controlling these prices, traders make them easier to predict future price movements.\n2. **Limited emotional influence**: Without emotions like fear, greed, or euphoria, trading reduces its risk-taking nature and allows for more rational decision making.\n3. **Time is money**: Trading gives traders a significant amount of time in which to make decisions. This can be used to take on higher risks (e.g., market correction) as well as lower ones (e.g., buying). The longer you hold, the more you can benefit from this strategy.\n4. **No emotional manipulation**: Traders are not overly influenced by emotions like fear or excitement, which can lead to impulsive decisions that may have negative consequences if their decision is made too quickly.\n5. **Diversification advantages**: Trading allows for diversification through a single position, which reduces risk by taking on additional capital and potentially leading to an earnings increase in case the underlying stock price improves.\n6. **Long-term stability**: By making long-term decisions without being swayed by short-term market fluctuations, traders can establish themselves as authorities in their industry or sector.\n7. **Strategic leverage**: Traders can use technical indicators and market analysis to make more profits with less capital than they would have made if they had a fixed position size or timing limit.\n8. **Reduced trading risks for the short-term**: With limited emotional influence, traders can avoid dealing with losses that may occur at any moment in time, rather than having to deal with them constantly.\n9. **Increased confidence**: Trading has been shown to boost individual confidence and trust in a stock market by providing more opportunities for long-term control.\n10. **Simplification of investment decisions**: The complexity of investing can make it easier to avoid emotional biases or impulsive decisions that may have negative consequences if their decision is made too quickly.\n11. **Enhanced appreciation benefits**: By taking advantage of time-to-moment market changes, traders can appreciate the potential gains from better trading strategies and lessening risks associated with short-term market fluctuations.\n12. **Reduced risk exposure**: Trading offers protection against volatility by limiting the impact that small price movements have on an investor's overall portfolio performance.\n\nIn summary, trading is a powerful way to secure a profit over time due to its ability to automate risk management through technology and limit emotional influences, making it easier for traders to make informed decisions about their investments.",

There are a great many candlestick patterns that indicate an opportunity within a market \u2013 some provide \ninsight into the balance between buying and selling pressures, while others identify continuation patterns or market \nindecision. CandlePatternsAll strategy calculates all candlestick pattern indicators that are available on the platform.\nEssentially, the strategy differs from the CandlePatternsMultiple strategy only by calculated indicator count and by \nthe way the list of indicators gets compiled. \nThis real body represents the price range between the open and close of that day's trading. When the real body is \nfilled in or black (also red), it means the close was lower than the open. If the real body is white (or green), the close \nwas higher than the open."
